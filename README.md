# Rock, Paper & Scissors Project

This project is an alternative version of the game "Rock, Paper and Scissors" with the name of **Meteorite, Star & Rocket**, but why ?

## What is Meteorite, Star & Rocket ?

This is a little game to train myself in Javascript, as well as to create a small intuitive interface, in the theme of space.

There are a few rules for this game :

-   ☄️ | The Meteorite beats the Rocket
-   ⭐ | The Star beats the Meteorite
-   🚀 | The Rocket beats the Star

You play as an astronaut and the aim of the game is to reach **5 points**, to thwart a Robot who wants to destroy us !

The live preview is available [here](https://assadev.github.io/Rock_Paper_Scissors/files/index.html), have fun.
